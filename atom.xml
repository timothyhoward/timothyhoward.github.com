			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A lot has been happening in my life over the last two and a bit years since I started university, and hence this blog as sat dormant for the most part. Over the last couple of weeks, I have again started writing, and hence I need a place to publish these long-form articles. Hence, I have decided to rejuvenate the weblog for this purpose. I will be publishing my thoughts, which usually cover topics such as African, American, Australian, and Middle Eastern Politics, as well as other areas such as International Law, Technology, Photography, and Culture &amp; Design. Thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy the weblog!</p>
