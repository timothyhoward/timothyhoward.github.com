**Hello, I'm Tim.** I am a 19 year old Bachelor of Arts undergrad at The University of Melbourne, majoring in Politics & International Studies. My interests include Technology (especially the Apple ecosystem), Politics, Photography, Culture & Designs and Football. I am a diehard Liverpool fan, also following Carlton F.C. in the Australian Football League, and Melbourne Heart F.C. in the Australian A-League. I also have an interest in social justice, previously travelling to Papua New Guinea and Southern India to build houses and accommodation for disadvantaged students. I aspire to be a Diplomat in the future, helping to tackle problems of poverty and discrimination in developing nations.
