<div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s hard to believe it&#8217;s been a month since <a href="http://log.valhallaisland.com/post/141205452">my accident</a>. It still feels like yesterday I was breathing the stifling air of the Princess Alexandra Hospital.</p>



<p>My recovery has been rapid and feels like it accelerates every day. I&#8217;m moving less cautiously and more freely, getting stronger and feeling less tired all the time.</p>



<p>Both my orthopaedic and maxillo facial outpatients appointments have gone well. The doctors are happy with my progress.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been back at work this past week, not full time but close to it. I handled it well except for Tuesday when I got extremely tired early and was useless for half the day. My boss has been giving me a ride to work each morning but I had the stamina to walk home the last three afternoons. Both being at work and walking home has done the world of good.</p>



<p>The only situation where my back continues to give me any pain is after lying down for hours. I can sleep for a couple of hours totally pain free but any longer than that and it starts to get more than uncomfortable. The only thing that can relieve it is standing or sitting up. I was getting up 3 or 4 times a night but lately it&#8217;s down to the once and the pain is low enough to sleep through most of the time. A week ago I&#8217;d be dying to get out of bed in the morning to relieve the pressure but now I&#8217;m able to hang around for a while. The difference sleeping better makes is huge.</p>



<p>My jaw is gradually getting stronger. I&#8217;m eating food with a little more substance now. I can eat a whole banana normally and can bite through a piece of chocolate if I suck on it for a little while. The more I work it the stronger it gets but I won&#8217;t be anywhere near eating properly until the bones are fully healed in another two and a half weeks.</p>



<p>My teeth still feel a little strange and I&#8217;m sure once the wire is taken out of my mouth in a bit over week I&#8217;m going to lose at least one tooth but I&#8217;ll deal with that then.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m hitting the scars across my face and neck with chlorsig twice a day without fail and it&#8217;s paying dividends. I still have no feeling at all down my nose and around the centre of my mouth. I can feel the nerves rebuilding themselves through the extreme itchiness that no scratching can appease. It seems feeling is creeping back into those areas.</p>



<p>In another week I start a back and neck rehabilitation program at the Wesley Hospital, just a block and a half from my apartment. It&#8217;s a thorough and intensive two week, full time program involving physiotherapists, occupational therapists, neurologists and psychiatrists. It&#8217;s supposed to be the best program available for rehabilitating my kind of injuries and is very expensive but thankfully covered by insurance.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m getting to the point where basic movement is no longer a problem and I&#8217;m itching to do more. Right up until the day of the accident I was running, riding or swimming at least an hour a half a day. That&#8217;s been followed by a month of almost complete inactivity. I&#8217;m looking forward to the rehab program because it&#8217;ll get me moving again with the medical supervision to make sure I don&#8217;t do any further damage to myself.</p>



<p>At the end of those two weeks my bones will be healed, I&#8217;ll be physically active and if not back to 100% strength I&#8217;ll be well on my way to complete recovery.</p>
